# RMuse: A sentiment analysis of Muse's discography

This project, written primarily in R, uses the SpotifyR package to extract data from Spotify's API and create visualizations that give insight into how Muse's discography has evolved over time. The primary packages used include: `ggplot2 dplyr tidyr corrplot`

Future plans involve creating regression models around the highly-correlated numerical features in dataset generated by the correlation plot in the graphics folder.

## Important Files

Here I include a description of each of the files in the repository as they relate to the project as a whole:

+ api_grabber.R - set the spotify API token and converts the dataframe in R into a csv file 
+ rmuse.R - includes the code for cleaning and filtering features as well as generating visualizations
+ musedata.csv - (99 row x 23 col) the dataset for analysis, for feature explinations please consult spotify's API documentation

+ ValenceGraphic.jpg - a graphic showing the general mood trend of Muse's discography
+ keycount.jpg - a graphic showing the distibution of keys that Muse songs are written in by album
